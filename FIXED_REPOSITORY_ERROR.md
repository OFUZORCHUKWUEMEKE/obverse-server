# 🔧 Fixed: Repository Sort Error

## ❌ **The Error:**
```
Error getting all payment links stats: TypeError: this.paymentLinkRepository.find(...).sort is not a function
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The CoreRepository's `find` method returns a Promise directly, not a MongoDB query object with chainable methods like `.sort()`.

## ✅ **The Fix:**
Changed from:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - This doesn't work with CoreRepository
const paymentLinks = await this.paymentLinkRepository
  .find({ creatorUserId: userObjectId })
  .sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

To:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Pass sort in options parameter
const paymentLinks = await this.paymentLinkRepository.find(
  { creatorUserId: userObjectId },
  {},
  { sort: { createdAt: -1 } }
);
```

## 🏗️ **CoreRepository Pattern:**
The CoreRepository `find` method signature is:
```typescript
find(
  entityFilterQuery: FilterQuery<T>,
  projection?: Record<string, unknown>,
  options?: QueryOptions
): Promise<T[]>
```

Where `options` can include:
- `sort`: Sort order
- `limit`: Limit results
- `skip`: Skip results
- `populate`: Populate references

## 🐛 **Added Debugging:**
Added console logs to help diagnose issues:
- User lookup verification
- Payment links count
- Error details

## 🧪 **Testing:**
The fix has been applied and the project builds successfully. Now when you run:

**Natural Language:**
```
"Show me all my payment link statistics"
```

**Or Commands:**
```
/linkstats
```

It should work without the sort error!

## 📋 **Additional Troubleshooting:**

**If you still get errors:**

1. **Check the console logs** - We added debugging output to help identify issues:
   - User lookup status
   - Payment links found count

2. **Verify you have payment links:**
   - Create one first with `/payment`
   - Make sure it was created successfully

3. **Check database connection:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Verify payment_links collection exists

4. **User authentication:**
   - Make sure your Telegram user exists in the users collection
   - Verify the user has the correct telegramId

## 🚀 **Ready to Use:**
The payment link tracking should now work correctly with both:
- Natural language queries
- Direct commands
- Proper error handling
- Debugging information

Try it now: **"Show me all my payment link statistics"**
